I am an undergraduate student with a statistics major. I took several statistics-related courses in school. I could use the ggplot to visualize the data. I am able to conduct a linear regression analysis, logistic regression analysis, experiment, and survey design. I have also written a few statistic reports, such as the cause of stress in the workplace.
